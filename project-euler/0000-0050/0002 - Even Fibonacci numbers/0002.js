 * @problem:
 *   Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms.
 *   By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
 *
 *   1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
 *
 *   By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four
 *   million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
